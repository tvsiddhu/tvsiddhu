- 👋 Hi, I’m @tvsiddhu
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Data and Cybersecurity related
- 🌱 I’m enjoy coding in python and very occasionally practice CTF/bug bounty
- 🩶 I love implementing GRC, SDLC, IT Risk management processes and practices (all the dirty rotten boring stuff true programmers hate)
- 🐾 My track record is built on delivering large complex projects successfully and rescuing those that are failing 😰
